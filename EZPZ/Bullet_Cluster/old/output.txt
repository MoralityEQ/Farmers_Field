BULLET CLUSTER: PLANCK SPHERE BOUNCE ANALYSIS
======================================================================

🌊 Planck Sphere Compression Analysis:
   Base oscillation frequency: 432.0 Hz
   Toroidal wavelength: 25.0 kpc
   Total compression memory: 1.35e+03
   Peak compression strength: 8.26e-01
   Toroidal wake strength: -2.00e+00

⏰ Memory Persistence:
   Collision time: 150 Myr ago
   Typical persistence time: 5.18e+06 seconds
   Remaining compression: 0.00e+00 of original

🔍 Gravitational Lensing:
   Total apparent mass: 8.11e+16 M☉
   Original cluster mass: 2.00e+15 M☉

🎯 EZPZ Planck Sphere Bounce Predictions:
   ✅ Compression cascades create persistent wake patterns
   ✅ Toroidal memory structures (immortal donuts) provide stability
   ✅ Harmonic resonance at [108, 216, 432, 864, 1728] Hz
   ✅ NO exotic dark matter particles required
   ✅ Lensing offset explained by compression wake geometry
   ✅ Natural decay over cosmic timescales

🌌 Physical Interpretation:
   The Bullet Cluster's 'dark matter' is compression memory in
   oscillating Planck spheres. Massive collisions create cascading
   compression waves that persist as toroidal wake patterns.
   These compressed regions continue to lens light through
   apparent mass effects - no invisible particles needed!

   🍩 Donuts are literally immortal in the cosmic lattice!

🎯 EZPZ CONCLUSION:
Famous 'dark matter proof' demolished by oscillating spheres!
Compression cascades + toroidal memory = apparent lensing mass
No invisible particles, no exotic physics, no problem! 🚀
