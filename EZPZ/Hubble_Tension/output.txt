\n🌊 Oscillation State Comparison:
   CMB         : 67 km/s/Mpc (freq: 4520 Hz, memory: 83253.8)
   LOCAL_SNE   : 73 km/s/Mpc (freq: 434 Hz, memory: 523.0)
   HIGHZ_SNE   : 70 km/s/Mpc (freq: 607 Hz, memory: 42.7)
\n🎵 Frequency Evolution:
   Early universe frequency: 4520 Hz
   Current frequency: 434 Hz
   Frequency relaxation: 10.4x
\n🍩 Memory Thinning:
   Early compression memory: 83253.8
   Current compression memory: 523.0
   Memory thinning factor: 159x
\n🎯 EZPZ Resolution:
   ⚡ No fundamental crisis - just compression evolution
   🌊 Early universe: High-frequency compressed spheres
   🎵 Current universe: Relaxed 432 Hz baseline
   📊 Both measurements correct for their compression epoch
   🍩 Toroidal patterns provide memory stability
   ✅ No exotic physics required!
\n🌌 EZPZ Physical Interpretation:
   The 'Hubble tension' dissolves when you realize the universe
   is just a lattice of breathing Planck spheres that relaxed
   from early high-compression states to the natural 432 Hz
   baseline. Different measurements sample different compression
   epochs. Both are correct! No crisis, no exotic physics.
   Just oscillating donuts doing their cosmic thing! 🍩⚡

\n🎯 EZPZ CONCLUSION:
Famous 'Hubble tension crisis' dissolved by oscillating spheres!
Early universe: High-frequency compression → thick memory
Current universe: 432 Hz baseline → thin memory
Different compression states = different H measurements
Both correct! No exotic physics! EZPZ! 🚀🍩
