=== FIELD-AWARE COSMOLOGY: PHASE 0 - NOTHING (THE STILL FIELD) ===

Creating Still Field (512×256)...
Dimensions: 512 × 256
Total lattice points: 131,072
Field value everywhere: 0.5
Standard deviation: 0.000000000000000
Information content: 0.0 bits/voxel
Time defined: False
Update rule: None
Coherence measure: inf (Absolute Coherence of Stillness)

Key insights (revisited with new understanding):
- The lattice structure exists as a static substrate, not energy or geometry.
- Every voxel holds identical value (Ψ₀) - perfect uniformity and resolved state.
- No gradients or ripples exist for information or 'force' to propagate.
- This is the 'nothing' from which everything emerges through compression.
- Time has not yet begun - no sequential ordering exists as there are no finite interactions.
- Perfect coherence of stillness exists, prior to the emergence of structured coherence.
- What appears as 'expansion' later is the resolution drift of memory, not an inherent field force.

Phase 0 establishes the cosmological boundary condition:
What does 'nothing' look like in Field-Aware Cosmology?
Answer: A uniform field with inherent structure (lattice) but no process or active dynamics.
