**Timeline of Likely Reset Events**  
*(Years are approximate and measured as "years ago" from present)*

---

**~65,000 years ago – Aboriginal Arrival / Post-Toba Reboot**  
- Oldest known continuous culture: Australian Aboriginals.  
- Dreamtime cosmology emerges, possibly rooted in pre-catastrophe memory.  
- Arrival may follow recovery from the Toba supereruption (~74,000 years ago), which bottlenecked global human population.

**~45,000 years ago – Global Megafauna Expansion & First Wave Colonizations**  
- Rapid expansion across continents, including into North America and Eurasia.  
- Could represent a rebound from a prior suppressed or reset civilization phase.  

**~12,900 – 11,700 years ago – Younger Dryas Impact Event**  
- Sudden global cooling event caused by comet fragments (Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis).  
- Associated with mass extinctions, ice sheet destabilization, sea level rise.  
- Likely destroyed high-coherence pre-Ice Age cultures (e.g., Gobekli Tepe builders).  
- Flood myths, broken megalithic timelines originate here.

**~10,500 years ago – Gobekli Tepe Burial**  
- Enigmatic megalithic site deliberately buried.  
- Represents knowledge concealment or ritual closure after catastrophe.  
- Marks a boundary between memory preservation and cultural amnesia.

**~8,000 years ago – Sahara Humid Period Ends**  
- Sahara rapidly shifts from green savannah to desert.  
- Collapse of pre-dynastic civilizations in North Africa.  
- Displacement leads to Nile Valley settlement boom; precursor to dynastic Egypt.

**~5,900 years ago (~3900 BCE) – 5.9 Kiloyear Event**  
- Major global aridification pulse.  
- Triggered collapses in early Mesopotamian, Indus, and Egyptian proto-cultures.  
- Possible trigger for large-scale urban consolidation and emergence of class structures.

**~4,200 years ago (~2200 BCE) – 4.2 Kiloyear Event / Akkadian Collapse**  
- Sudden drought and social upheaval across Mesopotamia, Egypt, Indus Valley.  
- Collapse of the Akkadian Empire.  
- First documented systemic reset with recorded aftermaths (famine, migration, myth).

**~3,200 years ago (~1200 BCE) – Bronze Age Collapse**  
- Sudden fall of multiple advanced civilizations: Mycenaeans, Hittites, Ugarit, and more.  
- Disruption of global trade, onset of Dark Age in the Mediterranean.  
- Sea Peoples invasion theory, volcanic activity, and systemic overcomplexity implicated.

**~2,000 years ago – Roman Fragmentation Begins**  
- Although not a hard reset, Rome's fragmentation marks a moral and infrastructural decline.  
- Transition toward feudalism and regional isolation.

**~1,200 years ago (~800 CE) – Mayan Collapse Phase 1**  
- Sudden abandonment of major cities.  
- Drought, political upheaval, and elite breakdown cited.  
- Aligns with parallel collapse signals in other parts of the world.

**~700 years ago (~1300s CE) – Little Ice Age Onset & Global Famines**  
- Major cooling period begins, linked with volcanic activity and solar minima.  
- Great Famine of 1315–1317 in Europe.  
- Mongol Empire fractures, global systems begin fraying.

**~400 years ago (~1600s CE) – Crisis of the Seventeenth Century**  
- Massive upheaval: war, plague, economic collapse across Europe and Asia.  
- May represent the most recent major coherence reset before the modern industrial arc.

**To Be Expanded:**
- Hopi cycle timings.  
- Atlantis temporal placement (if symbolic of prior phase).  
- Tunguska (1908) as micro-reset or warning.  
- 20th century global war contractions as moral resets.  
- COVID-19 as symbolic entropy climax.

**Compression Principle:** The more recent the reset, the faster the cycle. Earlier resets span millennia; later ones occur in centuries or decades. This suggests Field saturation approaching a phase transition.
