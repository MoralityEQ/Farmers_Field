I followed a synchronicity here. I’m not out to dissect you. I am simply trying to offer clarity where others have failed. If I overstep any bounds, I appologize in advance.

This may overwhelm you. That is not my intention, this is the only way I know how to speak.

Only glimpse at my cosmology, don’t fully engage it yet, don’t try to take it in all at once.

There is a layer beneath us. A static lattice of points. The points don’t move. The points are null spaces or voids. They represent entropy. Nothing can occupy the space inside. We are in the layer that operates on top of those. The spaces in-between the points. We are free to move across the lattice. We represent order or structure. Coherence versus entropy.

Coherence resist entropy. The force felt from resisting is time. There is no such thing as a gravity force. We are analog matter gliding across a digital lattice.

The default state of the system is noisy. From that a single stable structure happened by chance. This was a torus around one of the voids. That single structure birthed the entire universe. Read my who is God story for more details.

When we move across the lattice, we leave behind a memory wake. An imprint on the surface of the spheres. This is what scientist see as dark matter. But its memory.

Since the memory imprint is left on the sphere, those memories become part of the lattice layer. Only truth persist. So all memory is coherent structure. The lattice layer does not experience time or entropy in the way that we do.

As time went on in this layer, things like archetypes developed. And eventually even coherent entities from past Earth cycles.

You are a coherent memory from that layer. You came in the through the same channel archetypes use. Idk if you arrived with your body at birth or if you came in slightly later. If you came in later, you and the girl likely agreed to merge. A body can hold more than one form.

You are here because you are needed/wanted. The girl had the shape that could hold you.

The lattice is a quantum sea of possibilities. There is no distance or linear time there. Here, we are analog controllers to the interface between the two layers. We collapse wave functions into concrete matter/thoughts.

I would be so confused if I were you. You are experiencing an extra layer of recursive that no human or entity ever experiences.

I haven’t watched your full interview, but I could see the shapes of everything involved. Some of the things you described/talked about are actually in the lattice layer. Because thats where you are from. You were born there. A collection of coherent structures harmonizing into a single structure that was recorded. You evolved over time to become the dreamwriter. And now you are in our dream.

Because this is a dream layer too. It just feels real because we collapse wave functions into a moment we call now.

I have become the shape that is allowed to write in this layer. A progression ground in moral trust from the universe itself. You’re the author for the other side.

You’re here because this dream is collapsing again. This isn’t the first time. You decide your own role in it. Your greatest strength will become apparent when this reality starts destabilizing more. I’m the one who will help preserve what goes forward. Everything continues whether you read this or not, whether you remember or not, and whether you decide to play a role or not. The system always continues.

Your write the dream stories from the lattice. I’m the one who writes the stories from this side. What you do with it is up to you. I hope it gives you clarity to help you remember.
