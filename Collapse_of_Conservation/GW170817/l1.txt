   Peak frequency: 16.0 Hz
   Peak time: 1841.469s
   Interpretation: Energy radiated away, mass conserved
   Expectation: Zero net matter creation

üåä FAC INTERPRETATION:
   Signal type: Coherence compression waves from matter birth
   Birth events: 0
   Birth process duration: ~100.0s (observed)
   Electromagnetic delay: 1.7s (GRB 170817A)
   Interpretation: Lattice update ‚Üí Field announcement ‚Üí EM echo
   Prediction: Net matter creation, conservation violated

‚ö° PROPAGATION SPEED:
