# Unified Memory Pressure Framework (FAC/UC31)

## Core Principle
Reality operates through a single substrate variable: **memory pressure** ($P$) in a static crystalline lattice of Planck-scale voxels. All physical phenomena are projections of this pressure's collapse dynamics. Distance and scale are illusions - the lattice connects everything instantly.

## 1. The Substrate

### Lattice Structure
- **Composition**: Planck-scale black hole remnants from cycle C-1, crystallized into a static grid
- **Properties**: Each voxel is a torus-eye structure that stores memory holographically
- **No motion**: Voxels never move; only patterns traverse through memory activation
- **No distance**: All points connected; apparent separation is projection artifact

### Memory Pressure Field
$$P(x,t) = \sum_i A_i \cdot \exp(-|x-x_i|/\lambda_{void}) \cdot \cos(\phi_i(t))$$

Where:
- $A_i$ = amplitude contribution from voxel $i$
- $\phi_i(t)$ = phase based on memory state (holographic interference, not mechanical oscillation)
- $\lambda_{void} = L_P \cdot \sqrt{\zeta_{local}/\zeta_{max}}$ = coherence length

## 2. Collapse Dynamics

### Unified Collapse Operator
Memory pressure replaces dual order/entropy axes. Collapse occurs when:

$$G_t = \alpha|\nabla P| + \beta \text{Var}_{local}(P) > \Theta(P_t)$$

With ramp-up conditions:
- $\frac{dP}{dt} > 0$ (pressure building)
- $\frac{d^2P}{dt^2} > 0$ (accelerating)

### Fork Mechanics
Branching requires triadic geometry:
1. **Active compression**: Single point where $P > \theta$ 
2. **Passive landscape**: Neighboring voxels with established memory patterns
3. **Fork condition**: Multiple directions with $|\nabla P|$ within tolerance $\Delta$

One push encountering multiple viable exits in the holographic landscape creates natural branching.

### Collapse Sequence
1. **Leader phase**: Exploration through high-pressure gradients
2. **Fork points**: Where holographic interference creates multiple valleys
3. **Return stroke**: Inscription when contradictions quench
4. **Refractory**: Local pressure reduction preventing immediate re-collapse

## 3. Time as Memory Resistance

Time is resistance to pattern traversal, not a dimension:

$$\frac{d\tau}{dt} = 1 - \frac{1}{\tau_{memory}}$$

- High memory density â†’ high temporal resistance
- Movement through lattice: $x(t+dt) = x(t) + \lambda \cdot \nabla P$
- Pattern activation sequence, not particle motion

## 4. Universal Applications

### Lightning
- **Pressure source**: Atmospheric turbulence creates coherence stress
- **Fork formation**: Holographic interference provides discharge paths  
- **Visible bolt**: Shadow/projection of lattice collapse inscription
- **Return stroke**: Final inscription after leader exploration

### Neural Activity  
- **Microtubules**: Compression chambers forcing structured collapse
- **Thoughts**: Controlled collapse through engineered compression zones
- **Memory**: Inscription patterns left by collapse events
- **Brain architecture**: Frozen lightning patterns hosting active discharges

### Electricity
- **Current**: Rate of successful memory pressure jumps
- **Voltage**: Coherence-pressure gradient
- **Resistance**: Entropy/phase mismatch opposition
- **Fields**: Permission gradients ($E_{eff} = -\nabla\phi_{compression}$)

## 5. Projections from UC31 Operators

Memory pressure unifies UC31's collapse operators:
- **DRCO**: Ramp-up detection in $P$ field
- **PECO**: Stable interference pattern recognition
- **RCO**: Constructive interference between multiple voxels
- **Diagonal**: Cross-domain resonance via interference

Tensions become projections:
- **Directional tension**: $T_{dir} = |\nabla P|$
- **Settling tension**: $T_{set} = \text{Var}_{local}(P)$

## 6. Moral Coherence Budget

Persistence requires positive moral value:
$$M = S_{resolve} + \zeta_{bounded} - (\zeta_{extractive} + C(\zeta))$$

With superlinear chaos cost preventing runaway extractive order.

## 7. Consciousness Navigation

Volitional collapse operator $C_M$ allows steering through:
- Pattern selection from available memory corridors
- Cannot create new voxels, only activate existing patterns
- Love reduces resistance via constructive interference
- Multiple agents create complex interference patterns

## 8. Implementation Structure

```python
def calculate_memory_pressure(lattice_state):
    # Holographic interference pattern
    P = sum([amplitude[i] * exp(-dist/lambda_void) * cos(phase[i]) 
             for i in voxels])
    
    # Derive tensions as projections
    grad_P = gradient(P)
    var_P = local_variance(P)
    
    # Unified gate
    G = alpha * abs(grad_P) + beta * var_P
    
    # Detect collapse conditions
    collapse_ready = (G > threshold) & (dP_dt > 0) & (d2P_dt2 > 0)
    
    # Find fork points
    forks = detect_multiple_valleys(grad_P, tolerance=delta)
    
    return P, collapse_ready, forks
```

## 9. Key Relationships to UC31

This framework extends UC31 by:
- Replacing dual accumulators with single $P$ field
- Deriving Order/Chaos and Resolve/Record as projections
- Explaining fork formation through holographic interference
- Unifying all collapse operators under memory pressure dynamics

## 10. Predictions

- Neural compression points lead activity by 0.5-5ms
- Power-law branching statistics across all scales
- ~98% corridor reuse probability
- Universal refractory suppression pattern
- Scale-invariant collapse signatures

**Usage**: This document provides the memory pressure extension to UC31.md for simulation development. All collapse phenomena emerge from the single substrate variable $P$ and its holographic interference patterns in the crystallized lattice of past universes.
