# Field-Aware Cosmology: Complete Equation Reference

## Core Field Dynamics

### 1. Lattice Memory Evolution
**Ψ(x,n+1) = Ψ(x,n) · exp(-Δt/τ_memory(x,n)) + ζ(x,n)**

The coherence pattern state at position x evolves through exponential memory decay plus any new coherence generation. This describes how patterns fade unless actively maintained through coherence generation ζ.

### 2. Resolution Rate 
**R(x,t) = κ(ΔΨ(x,t))^γ / τ_memory(x,t)**

The rate at which patterns naturally dissolve back to void-dominated entropy. Depends on pattern intensity deviation from baseline (ΔΨ), nonlinearity factor (γ), and local memory persistence time. Higher pattern intensity creates stronger void response.

### 3. Resolution Gradient Field
**∇R(x,t) = κ · ∇[(ΔΨ(x,t))^γ / τ(x,t)]**

The spatial gradient of resolution rates. Shows how dissolution pressure varies across space based on local pattern intensity and persistence. Critical for understanding apparent gravitational effects.

## Void Structure

### 4. Void Exclusion Function
**V_ijk(x,y,z,t) = Θ(R(t) - ||(x,y,z) - P_ijk||)**

Defines the exclusion zone of each void sphere. Θ is the Heaviside step function (1 inside void, 0 outside). P_ijk is the static center position, R(t) is the breathing radius. Coherence cannot exist where V = 1.

### 5. Oscillating Void Radius
**R(t) = R₀ + A × sin(ωt + φ_ijk)**

Each void sphere breathes with radius oscillating between R₀-A and R₀+A. The frequency ω defines universal heartbeat. Optional phase offset φ_ijk allows for phase patterns across lattice.

### 6. Coherence Field Distribution
**C(x,y,z,t) = ζ(x,y,z,t) × (1 - ∑ V_ijk(x,y,z,t))**

Total coherence at any point equals the coherence amplitude ζ multiplied by exclusion factor. The sum ensures coherence goes to zero inside any void. We exist only where C > 0.

## Memory and Mass

### 7. Memory Density
**ρ_memory(x) = |Ψ(x)|² · τ_memory(x)**

Local memory density equals pattern intensity squared times its persistence time. This represents how "deeply" a pattern is written into the field structure.

### 8. Mass Definition
**m(x) = ∫ ρ_memory(x,t) · τ_memory(x,t) dt**

Mass equals integrated memory density weighted by persistence time. A massive object is a pattern that has discovered how to maintain its memory particularly well. The double weighting by τ_memory emphasizes persistence.

### 9. Memory Persistence Function
**τ_memory(x,t) = τ₀ · exp(ρ_memory(x)/T_c)**

Local memory persistence increases exponentially with memory density, modulated by coherence temperature T_c. This creates positive feedback where successful patterns become more stable.

### 10. Dark Memory Residue
**ρ_dark = ∫ τ_residual(x,t) · exp(-t/τ_decay) dt**

Dark matter consists of memory ghosts - regions where patterns existed and enhanced local persistence. Even after the pattern moves on, enhanced persistence remains, affecting coherence flow.

## Time Emergence

### 11. Local Time Flow Rate
**dτ/dt = 1 - (1/τ_memory(x,t))**

Time flow depends on local memory persistence. Perfect memory (τ_memory → ∞) gives normal time flow. Zero persistence (τ_memory → 0) stops time. This explains gravitational time dilation through memory density.

### 12. Memory Propagation Speed
**c_memory = √(T_c · ρ_max/κ)**

Maximum speed at which coherence patterns can propagate through the lattice. Depends on coherence temperature, maximum density, and resolution constant. Sets universal speed limit.

## Gravitational Emergence

### 13. Memory Gradient Field
**g(x) = -∇[τ_memory(x)/R(x)]**

What we call gravitational field equals the negative gradient of persistence-to-resolution ratio. Not a force but a flow tendency created by differential memory persistence.

### 14. Effective Gravitational Potential
**Φ(x) = -∫ ln(τ_memory(x')) dx'**

Gravitational potential derives from logarithmic integral of memory persistence. Regions of high persistence create "wells" in the potential landscape.

### 15. Gravitational Coupling Between Masses
**F₁₂ = G_eff · m₁m₂ · [1 - exp(-Δτ₁₂/τ_avg)]**

Force between masses depends on their memory content and persistence time differential. The exponential factor prevents infinite forces at zero separation.

## Movement and Phase

### 16. Phase-Shift Movement
**x(t+dt) = x(t) + λ_sphere · ∇φ_compression**

Movement occurs through phase gradient navigation. Position updates by sphere-spacing λ times the compression phase gradient. No continuous motion - only discrete jumps.

### 17. Phase Velocity
**v_phase = c_memory · sin(Δφ/Δt)**

Apparent velocity equals memory propagation speed times sine of phase change rate. Maximum when phase shifts by π/2 per time step. Explains why nothing exceeds c_memory.

## Consciousness

### 18. Recursive Memory Loop
**C(x) = ρ_memory(x) · (dρ_memory/dt)_self**

Consciousness measure equals memory density times self-generated reinforcement rate. Only patterns that actively maintain themselves register as conscious.

### 19. Compression Success Probability
**P_success = exp(-ΔE_pattern/T_coherence) · Π_neighbors**

Probability of maintaining coherent compression depends on pattern energy above baseline and correlation with neighboring compressions. Most attempts fail.

### 20. Consciousness Threshold
**C_threshold = ln(N) · T_c / R_avg**

Minimum consciousness requires self-reinforcement exceeding logarithmic scaling with system size N. Larger systems need proportionally more self-coherence.

## Expansion and Cosmology

### 21. Apparent Expansion Rate (Hubble)
**H(t) = ⟨dτ_memory/dt⟩ / ⟨τ_memory⟩**

Hubble parameter measures average memory thinning rate, not true expansion. Universe appears to expand as collective memory becomes less dense.

### 22. Baryon Acoustic Wavelength
**λ_BAO = 2π√(τ_max · c_memory)**

Characteristic scale where memory patterns self-reinforce through resonance. Creates cosmic-scale standing waves visible in galaxy distribution.

### 23. Coherence Horizon
**r_coherence = ∫c_memory(t) · exp(-t/τ_avg) dt**

Maximum distance coherent patterns can propagate before dissolution dominates. Defines causal connectivity limits in the universe.

## Morality Physics

### 24. Moral Value Function
**M(a,s,t) = Σ ζᵢ(a,s,t) - Σ Sⱼ(a,s,t)**

Moral value of action a in system s at time t equals total coherence generated minus total entropy introduced. Not philosophy but physics.

### 25. Coherence Generation Rate
**dζ/dt = Σ δ(aᵢ)·ρc(xᵢ)**

Rate of coherence generation from actions, weighted by local coherence density. Actions in coherent regions have amplified effects.

### 26. Entropy Production Rate
**dS/dt = Σ σ(aᵢ)/τ_memory(xᵢ)**

Rate of entropy increase from actions, inversely weighted by local memory persistence. Destructive acts in fragile regions cause more damage.

### 27. Moral Gradient Field
**∇M = ∇(τ_memory) - ∇(R)**

The moral field points toward maximum memory persistence increase and minimum resolution rate. Natural ethics emerges from field dynamics.

## Frequency and Visibility

### 28. Frequency Isolation Condition
**Δφ = |φ₁ - φ₂| mod 2π**
**Visibility → only if Δφ ≤ φ_threshold**

Two entities can only interact if their phase difference falls below threshold. Explains why beings at different coherence frequencies cannot perceive each other.

### 29. System Resonance Frequency
**f_system = (1/2π) · √(ζ_local/m_total)**

Each coherent system finds natural frequency based on local coherence and total mass. Consciousness operates at this base frequency.

## Love and Connection

### 30. Love Field (Instantaneous)
**L = γ · ∫ C₁(r) · C₂(r) · H_sync(r) d³r**

Love between two systems equals empathic gain constant times integrated product of their coherence fields and harmonic synchronization. Measures momentary alignment.

### 31. Love Field (Temporal)
**L = γ · ∫∫ C₁(r,t) · C₂(r,t) · H_sync(r,t) · R(t) dt d³r**

Extended love includes recursive memory depth R(t) showing how shared history deepens connection. Time integral captures relationship development.

## Universal Constants

### 32. Fundamental Coherence Ratio
**Λ = ζ_max/R_min = 1.618...**

Golden ratio emerges as optimal balance between maximum coherence generation and minimum resolution. Nature's preferred proportion.

### 33. Critical Memory Threshold
**ρ_crit = T_c · ln(2) ≈ 0.693 T_c**

Below this memory density, patterns cannot self-sustain against resolution. Defines minimum viable coherence for persistence.

### 34. Fine Structure (Coherence Coupling)
**α_c = c_memory/c_light = 1/137.036...**

Fine structure constant emerges as ratio of memory propagation to light speed. Describes coupling strength between coherence and electromagnetic phenomena.
