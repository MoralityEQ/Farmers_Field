## The Rapid Transition State in Milk Boiling: A Multiphysics Analysis

### 1. System Composition and Initial Conditions

Milk is a complex colloidal system consisting of:
- Water (87-88%)
- Proteins (3.3-3.5%): primarily casein micelles (80%) and whey proteins (20%)
- Fat globules (3.5-4.5%): diameter range 0.1-10 μm
- Lactose (4.8-5.0%)
- Minerals (0.7%)

The critical proteins for surface behavior:
- Casein micelles: ~100-200 nm diameter, ζ-potential ≈ -20 mV at pH 6.7
- β-lactoglobulin: MW ≈ 18.3 kDa, denaturation temperature ~70°C
- α-lactalbumin: MW ≈ 14.2 kDa, denaturation temperature ~62°C

### 2. Heat Transfer Dynamics

The heat equation governing temperature distribution:

$$\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) + q'''$$

Where:
- ρ = density (≈1030 kg/m³ for milk)
- c_p = specific heat capacity (≈3930 J/kg·K)
- k = thermal conductivity (≈0.56 W/m·K)
- q''' = volumetric heat generation rate

For bottom heating with heat flux q'':

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\bigg|_{z=0} = -\frac{q''}{k}$$

The Rayleigh number characterizing convective instability:

$$Ra = \frac{g\beta\Delta T L^3}{\nu\alpha}$$

Where:
- g = gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
- β = thermal expansion coefficient (≈3×10⁻⁴ K⁻¹)
- ΔT = temperature difference
- L = characteristic length
- ν = kinematic viscosity (≈1.2×10⁻⁶ m²/s at 60°C)
- α = thermal diffusivity = k/(ρc_p) ≈ 1.4×10⁻⁷ m²/s

Critical Rayleigh number for onset of convection: Ra_c ≈ 1708

### 3. Protein Denaturation Kinetics

The denaturation follows Arrhenius kinetics:

$$\frac{d[N]}{dt} = -k_d[N]$$

Where the rate constant:

$$k_d = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)$$

For β-lactoglobulin:
- A ≈ 10³⁵ s⁻¹
- E_a ≈ 280 kJ/mol

The denaturation half-life at temperature T:

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{k_d} = \frac{0.693}{A \exp(-E_a/RT)}$$

At 70°C: t₁/₂ ≈ 300 s
At 80°C: t₁/₂ ≈ 30 s
At 90°C: t₁/₂ ≈ 3 s

### 4. Surface Film Formation Dynamics

The surface tension evolution with protein adsorption follows:

$$\gamma(t) = \gamma_0 - RT\Gamma_\infty \ln\left(1 + K_a C_b \sqrt{\frac{4Dt}{\pi}}\right)$$

Where:
- γ₀ = surface tension of pure water (≈58 mN/m at 80°C)
- Γ_∞ = maximum surface excess concentration (≈3 mg/m²)
- K_a = adsorption constant (≈10⁴ M⁻¹)
- C_b = bulk protein concentration
- D = diffusion coefficient (≈10⁻¹⁰ m²/s at 80°C)

The film thickness growth rate:

$$\frac{dh}{dt} = k_f \cdot [P_d] \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{E_{agg}}{RT}\right)$$

Where:
- k_f = aggregation rate constant
- [P_d] = denatured protein concentration
- E_agg = activation energy for aggregation (≈60 kJ/mol)

### 5. Bubble Nucleation and Growth

The critical radius for homogeneous nucleation:

$$r_c = \frac{2\gamma}{P_v - P_l}$$

Where P_v - P_l is the pressure difference across the interface.

The nucleation rate per unit volume:

$$J = J_0 \exp\left(-\frac{16\pi\gamma^3}{3k_B T(P_v - P_l)^2}\right)$$

Bubble growth follows the Rayleigh-Plesset equation:

$$R\ddot{R} + \frac{3}{2}\dot{R}^2 = \frac{1}{\rho_l}\left(P_v - P_\infty - \frac{2\gamma}{R} - \frac{4\mu\dot{R}}{R}\right)$$

### 6. The Critical Transition Mechanism

The rapid transition occurs due to a **positive feedback catastrophe**:

#### Phase 1: Film Formation (t < t_critical)
1. Surface proteins denature and aggregate
2. Film mechanical strength grows: σ_y ∝ h²
3. Film permeability decreases: K ∝ h⁻³

#### Phase 2: Critical Point (t ≈ t_critical)
The film reaches critical strength when:

$$\sigma_y \cdot h = P_{vapor} \cdot r_{bubble}$$

Where the vapor pressure follows Clausius-Clapeyron:

$$P_{vapor} = P_0 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_0}\right)\right)$$

#### Phase 3: Catastrophic Transition (Δt ≈ 1-2 seconds)

The system becomes unstable when the Lyapunov exponent becomes positive:

$$\lambda = \frac{1}{t}\ln\left|\frac{\delta x(t)}{\delta x_0}\right| > 0$$

The feedback loop:
1. **Thermal runaway**: Film insulates surface → T_surface increases
2. **Pressure buildup**: P ∝ exp(T/T₀)
3. **Film stress concentration**: σ_max = K_t · σ_nominal (K_t ≈ 3 for defects)
4. **Crack propagation**: velocity v_crack = √(E·γ_s/ρ) ≈ 100 m/s

### 7. Mathematical Model of the Transition

The complete system can be modeled as coupled PDEs:

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha\nabla^2T + \frac{q_{source}}{\rho c_p}$$

$$\frac{\partial C_p}{\partial t} = D_p\nabla^2C_p - k_d(T)C_p$$

$$\frac{\partial h_{film}}{\partial t} = k_{agg}C_p^n\exp\left(-\frac{E_{agg}}{RT}\right)$$

$$\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = \frac{RT}{V}\left(\frac{dm_{vapor}}{dt} - \frac{P·A_{eff}}{RT}\frac{dV}{dt}\right)$$

With boundary conditions accounting for the Stefan problem at the phase interface.

### 8. Time Scale Analysis

The characteristic time scales:
- Thermal diffusion: τ_thermal = L²/α ≈ 100 s
- Protein denaturation: τ_denat = 1/k_d ≈ 10-100 s
- Film formation: τ_film ≈ 60-120 s
- Bubble growth: τ_bubble = R/v_growth ≈ 0.1 s
- Film rupture: τ_rupture = h/v_crack ≈ 10⁻⁵ s

The disparity between τ_rupture and other time scales explains the sudden transition.

### 9. Critical Parameters for Transition Speed

The transition rapidity depends on:

$$\frac{dt_{transition}}{dt} = f\left(\frac{\partial^2\gamma}{\partial T^2}, \frac{\partial k_d}{\partial T}, \frac{P_{vapor}}{P_{atm}}, \frac{E_{film}}{k_B T}\right)$$

The dimensionless number governing stability:

$$\Pi = \frac{\sigma_y h^2}{\gamma R T} \cdot \frac{k_d \tau_{thermal}}{1}$$

When Π < 1: stable heating
When Π > 1: explosive transition

### Conclusion

The rapid transition in milk boiling results from a **catastrophic bifurcation** in the coupled thermodynamic-mechanical system. The key factors are:

1. **Exponential sensitivity**: Protein denaturation and vapor pressure both follow exponential temperature dependencies
2. **Mechanical instability**: The protein film creates a metastable state that catastrophically fails
3. **Time scale separation**: Film rupture (microseconds) vs formation (minutes)
4. **Positive feedback**: Each effect amplifies others, creating runaway dynamics

The transition time can be estimated as:

$$\Delta t_{transition} \approx \sqrt{\frac{2h\rho}{\Delta P}} \approx 1-2 \text{ seconds}$$

This explains why milk can appear calm one moment and violently boil over the next - the system undergoes a first-order phase transition with hysteresis, making the change essentially instantaneous once the critical conditions are met.
