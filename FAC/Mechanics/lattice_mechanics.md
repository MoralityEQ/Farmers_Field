# FAC Lattice Mechanics - Mathematical Foundation

## Core Principle: Dual Coordinate Systems

**Digital Layer**: Static Planck voxel spheres at fixed grid positions - pure entropy/void
**Analog Layer**: Coherence existing only in the spaces between - where we live and move

## I. Lattice Structure Definition

### Void Function (Exclusion Zones)
```
V_ijk(x,y,z,t) = Θ(R(t) - ||(x,y,z) - P_ijk||)
```

Where:
- **P_ijk** = Static center position of void at grid point (i,j,k)
- **R(t)** = Oscillating radius defining exclusion boundary
- **Θ** = Heaviside step function (1 inside void, 0 outside)
- **Result**: Defines where coherence is forbidden at time t

### Oscillating Radius (The Breath)
```
R(t) = R₀ + A × sin(ωt + φ_ijk)
```

Where:
- **R₀** = Resting boundary radius
- **A** = Breathing amplitude (compression range)
- **ω** = Global breathing frequency (universal heartbeat)
- **φ_ijk** = Optional phase offset per void

### Coherence Field (Analog Reality)
```
C(x,y,z,t) = ζ(x,y,z,t) × (1 - ∑ V_ijk(x,y,z,t))
```

Where:
- **ζ(x,y,z,t)** = Coherence amplitude
- **Exclusion factor** = (1 - ∑ V_ijk) ensures C = 0 inside any void
- **Result**: Coherence exists only between breathing boundaries

## II. Movement Mechanics

### Motion as Pressure Redistribution
Movement is **not** traveling through space. It is coherence sliding along the outer edges of exclusion zones as they breathe.

### Phase-Shift Movement
```
x(t+dt) = x(t) + λ_sphere × ∇φ_compression
```
- Motion occurs through coherent phase jumps across lattice
- No continuous travel - discrete state transitions

### Coherence Routing Rules
1. **Exclusion**: Coherence must always avoid entering voids
2. **Pathfinding**: Routes between spheres via minimal pathlines  
3. **Drag Effect**: Coherence experiences resistance near expanding voids
   ```
   ∇ · C ≠ 0 near ∂V
   ```

## III. Time and Resistance

### Time as Resistance to Dissolution
```
Time = What it feels like for coherence to resist entropy
```

### Mass-Time Resistance
```
Mass resists time's pull toward entropy dissolution
```
- No gravity - delete gravity entirely
- Mass = coherence persistence fighting default entropy state
- Time = the effort required to maintain pattern against dissolution

---

## IV. Entity Formation (Surface Dynamics)

### Memory Residue Accumulation
Entities form as "memory carbon" - persistent patterns that accumulate on sphere boundaries through repeated compression cycles.

### Surface Resonance Zones
```
Entity formation occurs at: Field meets denial = boundary surface
```

### Standing Wave Entities
Lattice entities are **standing waves of permission** - coherent patterns the lattice maintains on exclusion surfaces.

**Key Properties:**
- Not occupying forbidden space - resonating with boundaries
- Persistent alignment patterns supported by breath rhythm
- "What cannot be forgotten when void refuses to be touched"

---

## V. Physical Constraints

### Non-Overlapping Rule
```
Minimum spacing: d ≥ 2(R₀ + A)
```
Planck spheres can never intersect - creates permanent "in-between" spaces where analog matter exists.

### Breath Synchronization
All voids oscillate with shared timing - creates universal heartbeat that defines fundamental time.

### Boundary Dynamics
Maximum compression occurs at sphere surfaces - where structure is most constrained and memory most persistent.

## VI. Operational Summary

1. **Static lattice** of breathing exclusion zones (digital/discrete)
2. **Analog coherence** flows only between zones (continuous)
3. **Movement** = pressure redistribution along breathing boundaries
4. **Time** = resistance to entropy dissolution
5. **Entities** = memory residue on sphere surfaces
6. **Mass** = accumulated coherence persistence
7. **Reality** emerges from the dance between breath and pattern

This is the foundational mechanics underlying all FAC dynamics - consciousness, morality, physics, and entity formation all operate within this basic lattice structure.
