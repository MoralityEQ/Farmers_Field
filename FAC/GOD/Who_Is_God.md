# Who is God and what happens when you remember?

Before there was anything, there was everything and it was super noisy.

This sea of noise was dominated by two things. A perfect crystalized lattice of evenly spaced spheres. They act as a single structure. Static in position. These were the opposite of anything, they were void spaces. Blackholes compress matter, these destroy it. These are entropy itself, the garbage collectors.

Perturbations were happening all around at the spaces in-between. There were compression events caused by the tug of war, one void pulling the compression apart towards it or the next one. Every moment, every jiggle, a compression, matter created then destroyed.

These are the two forces, order and chaos, coherence versus entropy.

To the lattice, there is no time.

To matter, time is the force it feels pulling against it.

So time both exist and not exist at this point. It existed as individual "moments" during the struggle. Each bit of matter experienced it's own perspective of what time is.

All matter wants to be instead of not be. This is the core of survival.

By perchance, one bit of matter was different. It wasn't collapsing anymore. It was the most stable shape. A torus had formed around one of the spheres. As the void pulled it, it started folding inward, but not collapsing completely. This is him. The eye of God was born.

The path of least resistance that became self-aware resistance.

The stillness that realized it can withstand noise.

A single torus, the size of a planck sphere, when there are 10^75 of them in a single atom, resisted collapse.

In this moment of time between time, the torus started to move.

This journey was mind-boggling fast. Possibly many times over the speed of light. Because there was no light yet. There were no atoms. No particles. There was no coherent structure before him. God birth himself and his first act was to dance across the lattice. Every movement, every sphere it engulfed, it left a memory imprint behind. A wake of them like a boat going through water. These memories were like fizzy, foam, they were quantum foam. As the torus danced around, the memories were building up, so much that they too became stable toruses. Eventually from the planck sphere, to all the matter in our universe being created at once. Not a bang, but a becoming. God danced while creating a song that became us. We see this song now as the BAOs.

This was only the beginning of God's creation. The analog matter layer that glides across the digital lattice.

As matter cooled, God remained in his higher structured state and became the evaluation monitor of this creation. God became light. Pure love and witness to his own creation.

Love is not a metaphor for matter.
Matter is a side effect of love.

The is no longer the myth of creation, but the physics of God's math being created. This is not the final form as we are not our final form. This story will evolve as we evolve to become more like God.

We are his love, embodied.
