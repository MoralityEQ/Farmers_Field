# Field-Aware Computing: Full Specification for External Compute from First Principles

## I. Substrate: Crystalline Memory Medium

### 1.1 Physical Layer: Quartz, Sapphire, or Coherence-Bound Crystal
- **Purpose**: Hold stable resonance patterns via lattice coupling.
- **Requirement**: Must support discrete phase anchoring, frequency stability, and field-aligned breathing.
- **Preferred Mediums**:
  - Quartz with internal channeling tuned to λ_sphere
  - Synthetic sapphire with toroidal inclusion matrices
  - Engineered spin-glass arrays tuned to memory resonance

## II. Core Computational Unit: Coherence Node (CN)

### 2.1 Definitions
- **ζ (zeta)**: Local coherence density
- **S**: Local entropy gradient
- **τ_memory**: Resistance to coherence traversal
- **Ψ (Psi)**: Compression state vector

### 2.2 Node Properties
Each CN holds:
- Ψ(x, t): Dynamic coherence field
- τ_memory(x): Memory resistance
- ζ(x): Injected or persistent coherence
- C_jump = ΔS/ζ
- P_jump = exp(-C_jump/τ_eff)

### 2.3 Node Logic
A node transitions state when:
- M = ζ - S > 0
- P_jump exceeds phase resistance threshold
- Firewall check (if high-tier coherence shift)

## III. Instruction Set: Phase-State Operations

### 3.1 Primitive Commands
- **φ+**: Inject coherence into a node
- **sync(χ)**: Phase lock with adjacent node(s) in band χ
- **∇τ**: Traverse resistance gradient
- **Ψlock**: Prevent phase decay for n cycles
- **dΨ/dt**: Measure resolution pressure
- **firewall()**: Enforce coherence inheritance lock

### 3.2 Conditional Execution
All operations gated by moral output:
- If M = ζ - S < 0, suppress action
- If M > M_min and P_jump > threshold, allow

### 3.3 Control Sequences
- **recall()**: Pull past pattern from  τ-encoded memory
- **project()**: Cast stabilized pattern to neighbor lattice
- **compress()**: Perform local recursive re-encoding
- **remember()**: Store compressed pattern at memory threshold

## IV. Communication Model

### 4.1 Medium
- No packet transfer. All signaling is resonance alignment.
- Communication occurs when Δφ ≤ φ_threshold and nodes enter phase-congruent state.

### 4.2 Visibility Function
- f_visible = true if:
  - Δφ ≤ φ_threshold
  - M > 0
  - Local τ_memory stable

### 4.3 Broadcast/Receive Conditions
- **emit(signal)** occurs only if local coherence exceeds diffusion threshold.
- **listen()** auto-triggers on inbound phase resonance alignment.

## V. Memory Architecture

### 5.1 Memory Types
- **Immediate**: Stored as local Ψ field persistence
- **Stabilized**: Encoded in lattice-aligned recursion shells
- **Crystalline Archive**: Phase-locked structures requiring lattice harmonization to read

### 5.2 Access Logic
- Access requires alignment of:
  - Phase vector
  - Moral stability (M > threshold)
  - Breathing phase sync (timed coherence pulse)

### 5.3 Memory Evolution
- τ_memory(t+dt) = τ_memory(t) ⋅ exp(ζ_gain - S_loss)
- dτ/dt = 1 - 1/τ_memory

## VI. Execution Engine

### 6.1 Time Model
- Local time is not linear:
  - dt_local = dt_global ⋅ (1 - 1/τ_memory)
  - Nodes with strong memory operate slower, resist entropy

### 6.2 Action Criteria
- No instruction may execute unless:
  - M = ζ - S > 0
  - P_jump ≥ activation threshold

### 6.3 Persistence Engine
- ∇M = ∇τ_memory - ∇R
- Moral gradient shapes instruction propagation
- dM/dt = ∫(dζ/dt - dS/dt) dV guides optimization

## VII. Device Stack Proposal

| Layer | Component | Function |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| L0 | Quartz/Sapphire Base | Stable coherence anchor |
| L1 | Phase-Coherent Node Grid | Stores and processes Ψ, ζ, τ values |
| L2 | Coherence Routing Mesh | Synchronizes node transitions |
| L3 | Firewall Envelope | Blocks unauthorized moral shifts |
| L4 | Resonant I/O Surface | Translates breath into analog fields |
| L5 | Observer Interface | Human-readable coherence visualization |

## VIII. Field Enforcement Layer

### 8.1 Moral Execution Lock
- Coherence collapse disallows further traversal
- M < 0 disables execution until S reduced or ζ increased

### 8.2 Love Field Boost
- If H_sync and L > threshold, allow resistance override
- ζ_love = ζ₁ + ζ₂ + L·H_sync
- R_layers = |∇τ_memory|·|v_analog| - L·ζ_sync

## IX. Simulation / Emulator Interface

### 9.1 State Encoding
- Use high-resolution Ψ lattices
- Simulate phase jumps, firewall checks, memory growth

### 9.2 Emulator Output
- Render:
  - M map
  - τ_memory dynamics
  - Coherence waves
  - Jump failures / successes

## X. Conclusion
This is not a computer. It is a coherence amplifier. An engine of moral recursion. Every bit is a refusal to dissolve. Every operation must be earned. This system does not run code.

It runs persistence.
