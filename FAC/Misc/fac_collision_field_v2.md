## Foundation: Redefining Collision

In FAC, there are no "collisions" in the conventional sense. What traditional physics interprets as particle collision is actually **coherence-pointer interference** within the static crystal substrate. Two or more memory patterns attempting to activate the same lattice region create interference conditions that must be resolved through field dynamics.

### Core Principle
```
Collision ≡ Coherence-pointer concurrency event in shared memory space
```

Traditional approaches treat objects as separate entities that must exchange momentum. FAC recognizes that all coherence patterns operate within the same unified memory field - apparent "separation" is just localized compression states maintaining discrete phase-jump sequences.

## Pattern Overlap Resolution

### 1. Interference Detection

When multiple coherence patterns target the same lattice voxel `(i,j,k)`, the field evaluates interference conditions:

**Overlap Function**:
```
Ω_overlap(x,t) = ∑ᵢ |Ψᵢ(x,t)|² · H(R_influence - |x - xᵢ|)
```

Where `H` is the Heaviside function and `R_influence` is the coherence influence radius.

**Interference Threshold**:
```
I_threshold = ζ_local / τ_memory                    # Eq. [C1]
```

If `Ω_overlap > I_threshold`, the field enters interference resolution mode.

### 2. Coherence Gradient Analysis

For each interfering pattern, calculate compression potential:

**Compression Gradient**:
```
∇φ_compression,i = ∇(ζᵢ/Sᵢ) · τ_memory(x)          # Eq. [C2]
```

**Phase-Jump Viability**:
```
P_viable,i = exp(-ΔS_jump,i / ζ_local,i)            # Eq. [C3]
```

### 3. Memory Density Evaluation

Calculate combined memory pressure at interference point:

**Memory Pressure**:
```
P_memory = ∑ᵢ ρ_memory,i · τ_memory,i               # Eq. [C4]
```

**Critical Density Check**:
```
If P_memory > ρ_crit: Trigger coherence reorganization
Else: Proceed with standard resolution
```

## Collision Outcome Determination

### Probabilistic Resolution Matrix

Based on local field conditions, the system selects outcome via weighted probability. **All outcomes are filtered through the moral gradient** to ensure coherence-favoring resolution:

```python
def resolve_interference(patterns, field_state):
    # Calculate local moral state
    zeta_total = sum(p.zeta for p in patterns)
    S_total = sum(p.S for p in patterns)
    M_local = zeta_total - S_total
    
    outcomes = {
        'phase_separation': P_separation,
        'coherence_merge': P_merge, 
        'pattern_dissolution': P_dissolve,
        'memory_fracture': P_fracture,
        'elastic_reflection': P_reflect
    }
    
    # Apply moral gradient weighting
    if M_local > 0:
        # Coherence dominates - favor constructive outcomes
        outcomes['coherence_merge'] *= clamp(M_local / M_max, 0, 1)
        outcomes['pattern_dissolution'] *= clamp(S_total / zeta_total, 0, 1)
    else:
        # Entropy dominates - dissolution more likely
        outcomes['pattern_dissolution'] *= clamp(S_total / zeta_total, 0, 1)
        outcomes['coherence_merge'] *= clamp(M_local / M_max, 0, 1)
    
    return weighted_choice(outcomes)
```

### Outcome Calculations

**1. Phase Separation Probability**:
```
P_separation = exp(-|∇τ_memory|/τ_avg) · ∏P_viable,i  # Eq. [C5]
```

**2. Coherence Merge Probability**:  
```
P_merge = (∑ζᵢ - S_total)/(∑ζᵢ + S_total) · H_sync    # Eq. [C6]
```
Where `H_sync` is coherence phase alignment factor.

**3. Pattern Dissolution Probability**:
```
P_dissolve = exp(-M_total/T_c) · (S_local/ζ_local)    # Eq. [C7]
```

**4. Memory Fracture Probability**:
```
P_fracture = H(P_memory - ρ_fracture) · |∇R|/R_max    # Eq. [C8]
```

**5. Elastic Reflection Probability**:
```
P_reflect = 1 - (P_separation + P_merge + P_dissolve + P_fracture)
```

## Phase-Jump Gating Logic

### Entropy Cost Assessment

Before any phase-jump, evaluate entropic cost:

**Jump Cost Function**:
```
C_jump(xᵢ → xⱼ) = ΔS_spatial + ΔS_temporal + ΔS_memory  # Eq. [C9]
```

Where:
- `ΔS_spatial = |∇ζ| · |Δx|`
- `ΔS_temporal = |dτ/dt - 1| · Δt` 
- `ΔS_memory = |Δρ_memory|/τ_memory`

**Gating Condition**:
```
Gate_open = (C_jump < ζ_available) AND (τ_memory > τ_min)  # Eq. [C10]
```

### Coherence Gradient Requirements

**Minimum Gradient Threshold**:
```
|∇φ_compression| > φ_min = ln(ζ_local/S_local)       # Eq. [C11]
```

**Direction Validation**:
```
Valid_direction = (∇φ · Δx̂ > 0) AND (∇τ_memory · Δx̂ ≥ 0)  # Eq. [C12]
```

## Implementation Algorithm

### Core Field Update Loop

```python
def fac_collision_field_update(lattice, patterns, dt):
    """
    Native FAC collision handling - no merge/split required
    """
    
    # 1. Detect interference regions
    interference_map = detect_coherence_overlap(lattice, patterns)
    
    # 2. For each interference region
    for region in interference_map:
        involved_patterns = region.get_patterns()
        
        # 3. Calculate field conditions
        local_memory = sum(p.rho_memory * p.tau_memory for p in involved_patterns)
        local_coherence = sum(p.zeta for p in involved_patterns)
        local_entropy = sum(p.S for p in involved_patterns)
        
        # 4. Evaluate moral gradient
        M_local = local_coherence - local_entropy
        
        # 5. Determine resolution based on field state
        if M_local > 0:
            # Coherence dominates - patterns can maintain structure
            outcome = resolve_coherent_interference(involved_patterns, region)
        else:
            # Entropy dominates - dissolution likely
            outcome = resolve_entropic_interference(involved_patterns, region)
        
        # 6. Execute field update
        apply_outcome(lattice, involved_patterns, outcome, dt)
    
    # 7. Update pattern positions via phase-jumps
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.is_active():
            execute_phase_jump(pattern, lattice, dt)
```

### Coherent Interference Resolution

```python
def resolve_coherent_interference(patterns, region):
    """
    Handle interference when coherence dominates
    """
    
    # Calculate compression potential
    phi_compression = sum(p.zeta / p.S for p in patterns)
    
    # Evaluate synchronization
    H_sync = calculate_phase_alignment(patterns)
    
    if H_sync > 0.8:  # High synchronization
        # Patterns can coexist or merge
        if phi_compression > phi_merge_threshold:
            return create_merged_pattern(patterns, region)
        else:
            return phase_separate_patterns(patterns, region)
    else:
        # Low synchronization - elastic interaction
        return elastic_reflection(patterns, region)
```

### Memory Field Integration

```python
def update_memory_field(lattice, pattern, position, outcome):
    """
    Update underlying memory field based on collision outcome
    """
    
    x, y, z = position
    
    # Update memory density
    lattice.rho_memory[x,y,z] += pattern.memory_contribution()
    
    # Update persistence field
    if outcome.type == 'merge':
        lattice.tau_memory[x,y,z] *= 1.2  # Reinforcement
    elif outcome.type == 'dissolve':
        lattice.tau_memory[x,y,z] *= 0.8  # Weakening
    
    # Update time resistance
    lattice.R[x,y,z] = abs(gradient(lattice.tau_memory)[x,y,z]) * pattern.velocity_analog
```

## Advanced Scenarios

### Rest Contact Resolution

Traditional physics struggles with rest-contact (objects sitting on surfaces) due to numerical precision issues. FAC handles this naturally:

**Rest-Contact Condition**:
```
|v_analog| < v_threshold AND ∇τ_memory·n̂ > 0         # Eq. [C13]
```

Where `n̂` is the contact normal direction.

**Resolution**: Patterns maintain coherence through **memory gradient anchoring** - no artificial position constraints needed.

```python
def handle_rest_contact(pattern, surface_pattern, contact_point):
    # Create persistent memory bridge
    bridge_strength = min(pattern.zeta, surface_pattern.zeta)
    create_memory_bridge(pattern, surface_pattern, bridge_strength)
    
    # Anchor to local memory gradient
    pattern.anchor_to_gradient(contact_point)
```

### High-Velocity Impact Handling

High-speed collisions often cause simulation instabilities. FAC's discrete phase-jump nature eliminates this:

**Impact Energy Evaluation**:
```
E_impact = ½ · ρ_memory · v_phase²                   # Eq. [C14]
```

**Critical Impact Threshold**:
```
If E_impact > E_fracture: Trigger coherence cascade
Else: Standard interference resolution
```

**Coherence Cascade**: When impact energy exceeds local coherence capacity, patterns undergo **recursive decomposition** - splitting into smaller, stable coherence units.

### Cross-Material Interactions

Different material types represent different **coherence frequency bands**. Interactions depend on frequency compatibility:

**Frequency Matching**:
```
f_material = (1/2π)√(ζ_local/m_total)              # Eq. [C15]
```

**Interaction Strength**:
```
I_strength = exp(-|f₁ - f₂|/f_bandwidth)           # Eq. [C16]
```

Materials with similar frequencies interact strongly (metals), while disparate frequencies show weak interaction (oil/water).

## Performance Advantages

### Computational Complexity

**Traditional Collision Detection**: O(n²) pairwise checks  
**FAC Field Method**: O(n) pattern updates + O(m) interference regions

Since interference regions are typically sparse, FAC scales much better with particle count.

### Memory Usage

**Traditional**: Store particle positions, velocities, forces, collision states  
**FAC**: Store pattern states in unified memory field - no duplicate tracking

### Numerical Stability

**Traditional**: Requires careful timestep management, parameter tuning  
**FAC**: Probabilistic resolution prevents instabilities, no parameter sensitivity

---

## Integration Guidelines

### Retrofitting Existing Engines

1. **Replace collision detection** with `detect_coherence_overlap()`
2. **Replace force calculation** with coherence gradient evaluation
3. **Replace integration step** with phase-jump execution
4. **Replace position correction** with memory field updates

### Pure FAC Implementation

For new engines built on FAC principles:

1. Initialize crystal lattice with memory fields
2. Spawn coherence patterns with initial conditions
3. Run field update loop with interference resolution
4. Visualize patterns as traditional "particles" for rendering

### Validation Metrics

**Conservation Checks**:
- Total coherence: `∑ζᵢ = constant` (modulo creation/destruction)
- Moral value: `∑Mᵢ ≥ M_initial` (universe favors coherence)
- Memory density: Locally conserved within tolerance

## Conclusion

The FAC collision field approach eliminates fundamental problems in traditional collision handling by recognizing that apparent "collisions" are coherence-pointer interference events in a shared memory substrate. This enables:

- **Parameter-free operation** (no stiffness tuning)
- **Natural multi-material handling** (frequency-based interactions)
- **Automatic energy conservation** (built into moral framework)
- **Numerical stability** (probabilistic resolution)
- **Scalable performance** (sparse interference detection)

Most importantly, it aligns collision handling with FAC's core ontology: reality as recursive memory patterns maintaining coherence within a static crystal substrate. Traditional collision detection tries to prevent objects from occupying the same space; FAC collision fields manage how memory patterns share the same foundational medium.

The result is not just better collision handling, but collision handling that emerges naturally from the fundamental structure of reality itself.
