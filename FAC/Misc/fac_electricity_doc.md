# Field-Aware Electricity: A Coherence-Based Interpretation of Electrical Phenomena

## Overview

This document redefines electricity through the lens of Field-Aware Cosmology (FAC), shifting away from classical charge-carrier and field-line models. Under FAC, electricity is not a physical flow of particles or energy but a structured propagation of **coherence** within the analog layer, mediated by discrete jumps across the **static digital lattice**.

## 1. Fundamental Premises

### 1.1 The Lattice
- Reality consists of a 3D grid of Planck-scale void spheres.
- These voids are static and non-interacting, forming the digital backbone.
- All analog activity, including matter and motion, occurs as **coherence states** hopping between these lattice nodes.

### 1.2 Analog Field
- Coherence patterns persist in the analog layer through recursive compression loops.
- Movement is not continuous; it is quantized as **phase jumps** between lattice sites.
- Each successful phase jump represents the transfer of structured memory, not substance.

## 2. Redefining Electricity

### 2.1 Classical Misinterpretation
- Electrons are not carriers of energy but **anchors for lattice-localized memory**.
- Electromagnetic fields are **coherence gradients**, not independent entities.
- Energy flow is not spatial drift, but **recursive pattern reinforcement**.

### 2.2 FAC Definition
**Electricity** = The **recursively sustained compression pattern** propagating across allowed lattice paths, constrained by local coherence density (\( \zeta \)) and memory resistance (\( \tau_{memory} \)).

Mathematically:
\[
\Psi(x, n+1) = \Psi(x, n) \cdot e^{-\Delta t / \tau_{memory}} + \zeta(x, n)
\]

Where:
- \( \Psi \): Compression state
- \( \tau_{memory} \): Local resistance to coherence traversal
- \( \zeta \): Injected coherence from external sources (e.g., power supply)

## 3. Wire Function and Conduction

### 3.1 The Wire as Lattice Anchor
- A conductor is not a tube for particles; it's a **memory pathway stabilizer**.
- Conductive materials reduce \( \nabla \tau_{memory} \), enabling stable phase jumping.
- Electrical current reflects the **rate of successful recursion along a defined path**.

### 3.2 Voltage
**Voltage** = Local difference in lattice pressure to coherence traversal.

Formally:
\[
V \propto \Delta \zeta / \Delta x
\]

### 3.3 Resistance
**Resistance** = Opposition to coherent recursion. Defined by the entropy gradient and material-induced phase mismatches:
\[
R \propto \nabla S / \zeta
\]

## 4. Electromagnetic Fields Reinterpreted

### 4.1 The Electric Field (\( \vec{E} \))
Represents the **gradient of coherence potential** due to charge asymmetries:
\[
\vec{E} = -\nabla \phi_{compression} \quad \text{where} \quad \phi_{compression} = \zeta / S
\]

### 4.2 The Magnetic Field (\( \vec{B} \))
Emerges from **rotating or self-looping compression patterns**. It is not a separate force, but a **feedback trace of recursion in motion**.

## 5. Antennas and EM Propagation

### 5.1 Antennas as Coherence Funnels
- Antennas are devices tuned to the **breathing rhythm of lattice sites**.
- They convert analog compression loops into lattice-aligned coherence bursts.
- Reception is achieved when incoming Field patterns match local \( \zeta \) oscillation bandwidths.

### 5.2 Signal Propagation
**EM wave propagation** is not field oscillation through empty space but a **traveling recursion permission pattern**:
\[
c_{light} = \sqrt{T_c \cdot \rho_{max} / \kappa}
\]

This defines the speed of lattice-bounded coherence traversal.

## 6. Capacitors and Inductors

### 6.1 Capacitors
- Store **coherence tension** between separated lattice zones.
- Plate separation defines the \( \nabla \tau_{memory} \), creating potential energy.

### 6.2 Inductors
- Encode **rotating recursion** (magnetic memory).
- Store energy as structured looped phase patterns.

## 7. Implications for Simulation

To simulate electricity in FAC terms:
- Use **Ψ fields** on a static lattice with time-evolving coherence amplitudes.
- Phase jumps must respect \( \tau_{memory} \) and local entropy.
- Energy transfer = number of successful phase jumps per cycle.

## 8. Summary

Electricity is not a thing. It is the **recursive propagation of coherence** through a medium that allows pattern survival.

Charge is an emergent effect. Fields are derivative. Current is an illusion.

What exists is a pattern — refusing to dissolve — reinforced at every step by the universe’s moral preference:

\[M = \zeta - S\]
