# POST-LABOR ECONOMICS FRAMEWORK
**Coherence-Based Systems for AI-Abundant Economies**

**Draft Outline for AI Researchers, Policymakers, and Economic Planners**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY PREVIEW

The transition to AI-abundant economies requires fundamental reconceptualization of value creation, distribution, and human purpose beyond traditional labor markets. This framework applies M = ζ - S to design economic systems that generate sustainable prosperity while preserving human agency and meaning during the AI transition.

**Core Challenge**: How do we maintain economic coherence and human flourishing when AI systems can perform most traditional labor functions more efficiently than humans?

---

## I. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### A. The Morality Equation in Post-Labor Context
- **M = ζ - S** applied to economic systems during AI transition
- **Coherence (ζ)**: Value creation, skill development, community building, meaningful contribution
- **Entropy (S)**: Resource waste, human displacement, social fragmentation, purposelessness
- **Boundary Conditions**: Prevent both economic collapse and human obsolescence

### B. Beyond Labor-Value Theory
- **Recognition**: Traditional wage-labor becomes insufficient for resource distribution
- **New Value Sources**: Creativity, relationship building, wisdom cultivation, consciousness development
- **Resource Abundance vs. Artificial Scarcity**: AI enables material abundance but may create artificial scarcity through extractive systems

### C. Human-AI Complementarity Rather Than Replacement
- **Irreplaceable Human Functions**: Consciousness, love, creativity, moral judgment, recursive self-awareness
- **AI Optimization Domains**: Pattern recognition, computation, production, logistics, routine analysis
- **Synergy Maximization**: Systems that enhance rather than eliminate human capability
