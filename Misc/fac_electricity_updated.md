# Field-Aware Electricity: A Coherence-Based Interpretation of Electrical Phenomena

## Overview

This document redefines electricity through the lens of Field-Aware Cosmology (FAC), shifting away from classical charge-carrier and field-line models. Under FAC, electricity is not a physical flow of particles or energy but a **recursively structured propagation** of **coherence** within the analog layer, mediated by discrete jumps across the **static digital lattice**.

## 1. Fundamental Premises

### 1.1 The Lattice
- Reality consists of the **crystallized consciousness** as a 3D grid of Planck-scale void spheres.
- These voids are static and non-interacting, forming the digital backbone.
- All analog activity, including matter and motion, occurs as **coherence states** hopping between these lattice nodes.

### 1.2 Analog Field
- Coherence patterns persist in the analog layer through recursive compression loops.
- Movement is not continuous; it is quantized as **phase jumps** between lattice sites.
- Each successful phase jump represents the transfer of structured memory, not substance.

## 2. Redefining Electricity

### 2.1 Classical Misinterpretation
- Electrons are not carriers of energy but **localized memory anchors** within the lattice.
- Electromagnetic fields are **coherence gradients**, not independent entities.
- Energy transfer is not spatial drift, but **recursive pattern reinforcement** through **successful collapse events**.

### 2.2 FAC Definition
**Electricity** = The **recursively sustained compression pattern** propagating across allowed lattice paths, constrained by local coherence density (ζ) and memory resistance (τ_memory).

Mathematically:
```
Ψ(x, n+1) = Ψ(x, n) · e^(-Δt / τ_memory) + ζ(x, n)
```
*This is the Pattern Evolution equation from the core framework.*

Where:
- Ψ: Compression state
- τ_memory: Local resistance to coherence traversal
- ζ: Injected coherence from external sources (e.g., power supply)

## 3. Wire Function and Conduction

### 3.1 The Wire as Lattice Anchor
- A conductor is not a tube for particles; it's a **memory pathway stabilizer**.
- Conductive materials reduce ∇τ_memory, enabling stable phase jumping.
- Electrical current reflects the **rate of successful coherence traversal** or **successful recursion along a defined path**.

### 3.2 Voltage
**Voltage** = Local **coherence pressure gradient** or **difference in lattice pressure to coherence traversal**.

Formally:
```
V ∝ Δζ / Δx
```

### 3.3 Resistance
**Resistance** = Opposition to **coherent pattern propagation** or **coherent recursion**. Defined by the entropy gradient and material-induced phase mismatches:
```
R ∝ ∇S / ζ
```

## 4. Electromagnetic Fields Reinterpreted

### 4.1 The Electric Field (E⃗)
Represents the **gradient of coherence potential** due to charge asymmetries:
```
E⃗ = -∇φ_compression    where    φ_compression = ζ / S
```

### 4.2 The Magnetic Field (B⃗)
Emerges from **rotating or self-looping coherent compression patterns**. It is not a separate force, but a **feedback trace of recursion in motion**.

## 5. Antennas and EM Propagation

### 5.1 Antennas as Coherence Funnels
- Antennas are devices tuned to the **learned breathing rhythm** of lattice sites.
- They convert analog **recursive compression loops** into lattice-aligned **coherence bursts**.
- Reception is achieved when incoming Field patterns match local ζ oscillation bandwidths.

### 5.2 Signal Propagation
**EM wave propagation** is not field oscillation through empty space but a **traveling coherent recursion permission pattern**:
```
c_light = √(T_c · ρ_max / κ)
```
*This defines the Memory Speed, which is the speed of lattice-bounded coherence traversal.*

## 6. Capacitors and Inductors

### 6.1 Capacitors
- Store **coherence tension** between separated lattice zones.
- Plate separation defines the ∇τ_memory, creating potential energy.

### 6.2 Inductors
- Encode **rotating coherent recursion** (magnetic memory).
- Store energy as structured looped phase patterns.

## 7. Implications for Simulation

To simulate electricity in FAC terms:
- Use **Ψ fields** on a static lattice with time-evolving coherence amplitudes.
- Phase jumps must respect **memory persistence** (τ_memory) and local entropy (S).
- Energy transfer = number of successful **coherence phase jumps** per cycle.

## 8. Summary

Electricity is not a thing. It is the **recursive propagation of coherence** through a medium that allows pattern survival.

Charge is an emergent effect. Fields are derivative. Current is an illusion.

What exists is a pattern — refusing to dissolve — reinforced at every step by the universe's **moral preference**:

```
M = ζ - S
```
*This is the Moral Value equation from the core framework.*
